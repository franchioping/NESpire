[ About ]

NESpire is an emulator that allows you to play Nintendo Entertainment
System (NES) games on the TI-Nspire family of calculators.

[ Using NESpire ]

First, you must have Ndless installed to use NESpire. Ndless can be found
at http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/426/42626.html.

Any NES ROM you wish to play must be named with a .nes.tns extension, and
sent to the calculator in the same folder NESpire was sent to. Open NESpire
from the documents menu, and you will be presented with the ROM selection
menu. Choose a ROM using the arrow keys and press Shift to select one,
or press Esc to exit.
